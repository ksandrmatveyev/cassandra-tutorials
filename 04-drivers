# Drivers
 - API is similr between languages
 - Policies are the same (load balancing, rebalancing, etc.)

You connect to the cluster, not to a single server

# Python Example
 - create a cluster object
 - use the cluster to obtain a session
 - session manages connections to the cluster (maintaing connections to the cluster itself and keeping track of things that are happening. It is caled GOSSIP)

'''
# one entity which can be multiple servers, but it is a single cluster according to our application
from cassandra.cluster import Cluster
cluster = Cluster(protocol_version = 3) 
session = cluster.connect('killrvideo')
'''

INSERT
'''
session.execute("""
INSERT INTO table ()
VALUES ()
""")
'''

SELECT
'''
rsult = session.execute("SELECT * FROM table WHERE userid=")[0]
print result.firstname, reult.lastname, result.email
'''



# Pyrhon driver task
'''
from cassandra.cluster import Cluster
cluster = Cluster(protocol_version = 3)
session = cluster.connect('killrvideo')
'''

'''
result = session.execute("SELECT * FROM videos_by_tag")
for val in result:
    print val[0]
'''

session.execute() returns a sequence of rows (tuples), which you can further index into to get cell values. Try executing the following:

'''
print('{0:12} {1:40} {2:5}'.format('Tag', 'ID', 'Title'))
for val in session.execute("select * from videos_by_tag"):
    print('{0:12} {1:40} {2:5}'.format(val[0], val[2], val[3]))
'''

INSERT DATA
'''
session.execute(
    "INSERT INTO videos_by_tag (tag, added_date, video_id, title)" +
    "VALUES ('cassandra', '2013-01-10', uuid(), 'Cassandra Is My Friend')")
'''



if we want to delete raw we must specify partition key and clustering columns in order. I mean if we have primary key as ((tag),date,uid). We must write:

'''
session.execute(
"DELETE FROM videos_by_tag WHERE tag='datastax' AND added_date='2015-1-1'"
)
'''
Above is not valid, because we can delete another rows

'''
session.execute(
"DELETE FROM videos_by_tag WHERE tag='datastax' AND added_date='2015-1-1' AND video_id=4845ed97-14bd-11e5-8a40-8338255b7e34"
)
'''
NOT
'''
session.execute(
"DELETE FROM videos_by_tag WHERE tag='datastax' AND video_id=4845ed97-14bd-11e5-8a40-8338255b7e34"
)
