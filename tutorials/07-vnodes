# VNODES
We can have hot pot of cluster when one node have more ddat then another

Virtual nodes allow us creates individual smaller ranges per node, and it breaks up these ranges across the cluster. Now node don't have all data (256 ranges by default)

Each node has severl tokens it manages

Vnodes Details:
 - adding/removing nodes with vnodes should not make the cluter unbalanced
 - by default each node has 256 vnodes
 - vnodes automate token range assignment

Configuration:
 - Configure vnode settings in cassandra.yaml
 - num_tokens
 - value greater than one turns on vnodes
