# PARTITIONS
 - parts of data
 - grouping of data (by state as partition key)
Partitoner's job is to take a partition key and create a token

Example:
take state "texas" and send it through the system, we'll get 24 (NY - 58, CA - 83). When we done,
we now translated partition key into a token value (one of those partition ranges). And so each one of these is assigned to a different partition of data
How we determine partition scheme?
We put it a primary key. first value of primary key is a partition key, which alone not unique enough. That's why we add ID - called a clustering column
How data stored in a cluster?
each partition (because it has a partition key), is given a range of data, each partition is probably gonna live in separate node (random)

# DESRIBE TABLES
'''
DESCRIBE TABLE videos;
'''

# view the partitioner token value for each video id
'''
SELECT token(id), id
FROM videos;
